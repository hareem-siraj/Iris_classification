# Iris_classification


Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. We have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species. I trained three different machine learning models that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them. Following are the models created:
1) Logistic Regression
2) Support vector machine algorithm
3) Decision Tree Classifier
